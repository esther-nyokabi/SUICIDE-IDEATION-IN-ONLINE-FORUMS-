# SUICIDE-IDEATION-IN-ONLINE-FORUMS-


Social media platforms have become a channel for individuals to express their emotions, including suicidal ideation, posing a significant challenge to mental health professionals worldwide. However, identifying individuals expressing suicidal ideation online is difficult, particularly for government and mental health organizations.

Our goal is to build an NLP model capable of accurately detecting posts related to depression and suicide in text. This tool will aid governments and mental health organizations in identifying individuals expressing suicidal ideation online and providing timely support to prevent suicide attempts.
